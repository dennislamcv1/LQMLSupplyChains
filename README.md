## Machine Learning for Supply Chains Specialization

### About this Specialization


This specialization is intended for students who wish to use machine language to analyze and predict product usage and other similar tasks. There is no specific prerequisite but some general knowledge of supply chain will be helpful, as well as general statistics and calculus.

### Applied Learning Project

You will learn and practice skills as you go through each of the courses, using the Coursera lab environment. The final course is a capstone project where you will analyze data and make predictions about retail product usage, and then calculate optimal safety stock storage.
